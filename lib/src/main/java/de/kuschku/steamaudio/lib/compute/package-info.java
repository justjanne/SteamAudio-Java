 * Functions for controlling an OpenCL compute device. Phonon requires OpenCL when used with the following third-party
 * technologies:
 * <ul>
 * <li>AMD Radeon Rays</li>
 * <li>AMD TrueAudio Next</li>
 * </ul>
 * If you are not using one of the above technologies, you do not need to call any of the Phonon API functions
 * that deal with OpenCL Compute Device objects.
