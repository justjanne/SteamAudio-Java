 * Functions for calculating various properties of direct sound. Direct sound is defined as sound that reaches the
 * listener directly from the source, without any reflections from the environment. The Phonon API contains functions
 * for calculating various parameters of direct sound, but the task of applying these properties to audio data is left
 * up to the audio engine.
