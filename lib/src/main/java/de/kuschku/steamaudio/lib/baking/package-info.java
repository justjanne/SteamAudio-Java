/**
 * <h1>Baking</h1>
 * <p>
 * Functions for baking sound propagation information into acoustic probes. Baking allows detailed acoustic responses to
 * be calculated at design time (just like precomputed lighting), resulting in higher quality sound propagation effects,
 * reduced CPU usage, but increased memory and disk space usage. Phonon lets you bake parametric or convolution reverb
 * at each probe, as well as source-to-listener sound propagation effects from various sources.
